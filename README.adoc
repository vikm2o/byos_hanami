== Requirements

. {git_link}.
. {docker_link}.
. {hanami_link} (optional, for development).
. {ruby_link} (optional, for development).
. {postgres_link} (optional, for development).
. {valkey_link} (optional, for development): Can be swapped out for {redis_link} or {dragonfly_link} if desired.
. {chrome_link} (optional, for development): For screen generation via the headless browser.
. {overmind_link} (optional, for development): Uses your `Procfile` to launch processes.
. {trmnl_link} device (or use a virtual device within the application).

== Quick Start

To immediately spin up Terminus on your local machine, run:

[source,bash]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami/refs/heads/main/scripts/quick.sh | bash
----

Once launched, open `http://localhost:2300` in your browser then click on the _Register_ link to register and log into the system.

💡 This script is not idempotent which means you can't run it more than once since your database credentials will be different each time. It's only meant for getting up and running quickly. To customize, see the link:doc/docker.adoc[Docker] documentation.

== Setup

To set up this project for local development, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami terminus
cd terminus
bin/setup
----

💡 The setup script is idempotent so you can run it multiple times without harm. To rebuild a file managed by the setup script, delete the desired file and rerun setup to recreate.

== Upgrade

To upgrade this project for local development, run:

[source,bash]
----
cd terminus
bin/upgrade
----

Watch for any changes that need to be addressed in the output. Otherwise, if no changes are detected, you are all set.

== Usage

To launch the server, run:

[source,bash]
----
# Development
overmind start --port-step 10 --procfile Procfile.dev --can-die assets,migrate

# Production
overmind start --port-step 10 --can-die assets,migrate
----

To view the app, use either of the following:

* *Secure*: https://localhost:2443
* *Insecure*: http://localhost:2300

From your browser, you can then click on the _Register_ link to register and log into the system.

=== Configuration

There are several environment variables you can use to customize behavior by updating the `.env` file created for you during setup. They are:

* `API_URI`: Used for connecting your device to this server or via link:doc/docker.adoc[Docker]. Defaults to your host machine's IP address and port. This assumes you are connecting your device directly to the same server Terminus is running on. If this is not the case and you are using a reverse proxy, DNS, or any service/layer between your device and Terminus then you need to update this value to be your host. For example, if your host is `http://demo.io` then this value must be `http://demo.io`. This includes updating your device, via the TRMNL captive Wifi portal, to use `http://demo.io` as your custom host too. How you configure `http://demo.io` to resolve to the server you are running Terminus on is up to you. All your device (and this value) cares about is what the external host (or IP and port) is for the device to make API requests too (they must be identical).
* `API_ACCESS_TOKEN_PERIOD`: Used to set the amount of time, in seconds, the JWT access token remains valid before needing to refresh your token. This is only necessary when using the link:doc/api.adoc[Server APIs]. Default: 1,800 seconds (30 minutes).
* `APP_SECRET`: Used for session, cookie, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This is automatically created for you during setup but is recommended that you update this with your own secure value.
* `BROWSER`: Used for configuring headless browser behavior when creating screens for your device. Must be a JSON object. Default: `'{"js_errors": true, "process_timeout": 10, "timeout": 10}'`. Additional keys are ignored. For more details, see the link:https://github.com/rubycdp/ferrum#customization[Ferrum Customization Documentation].
* `DATABASE_URL`: Necessary to connect to your {postgres_link} database. Can be customized by changing the value in the `.env.development` or `.env.test` file created when you ran `bin/setup`.
* `FIRMWARE_POLLER`: Enables/disables firmware polling. See {background_pollers_link} for details. Defaults to enabled.
* `HANAMI_PORT`: The default port when running the app locally or via {docker_doc_link}. When using Docker, this is used for the internal and external port mapping.
* `MODEL_POLLER`: Enables/disables model polling. See {background_pollers_link} for details. Defaults to enabled.
* `RACK_ATTACK_ALLOWED_SUBNETS`: Defines the {rack_attack_link} subnets that are allowed to connect to this server which helps when adding DNS, a reverse proxy, or a VPN, etc. between your device and this application so you can use this environment variable to add more subnets as desired. This takes a single subnet/IP or an array -- with no spaces -- of subnets/IPs as values. Example: "111.111.111.111,150.120.0.0/16". Alternatively, you can disable Rack Attack altogether by removing the `config.middleware.use Rack::Attack` line from `config/app.rb` or customize Rack Attack via the `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb` file. Any of these approaches will allow you to get your service layer properly configured so your device can talk to this server. By default, the following subnets are allowed: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1`.
* `DATABASE_NAME`: Defines your database name. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `terminus`.
* `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Defines your database password. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: (auto-generated for you during setup).
* `DATABASE_PORT`: Defines your database port. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `5432`.
* `DATABASE_USER`: Defines your database user. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `terminus`.
* `DATABASE_URL`: Defines the full URL based on the above `+DATABASE_*+` settings. This is automatically configured for you during setup. See your `+.env*+` files for details.
* `KEYVALUE_DATABASE`: Defines your database ID. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `0`.
* `KEYVALUE_PASSWORD`: Defines your password. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: (auto-generated for you during setup).
* `KEYVALUE_PORT`: Defines your port. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `6379`.
* `KEYVALUE_URL`: Defines the full URL based on the above `+KEYVALUE_*+` settings. This is automatically configured for you during setup. See your `+.env*+` files for details.
* `SCREEN_POLLER`: Enables/disables model polling. See {background_pollers_link} for details. Defaults to enabled.
* `CERTIFICATE_URLS`: Define as a comma-separated list of CA certificate URLs, and the Docker Compose setup with install those certificates as trusted in the containers. Used by {docker_doc_link} only.

=== Users

When launching this application for the first time, there will be no users. The first user to register will automatically be given _Verified_ status along with full access to the system. All subsequent users will marked as _Unverified_ and must be manually _Verified_ in order to have access to the system. In the future, more fine grained control will be provided for individual users, roles, and permissions.

Also, once logged in, you can manage your settings as follows:

* Visit `/me/login` to update your email address.
* Visit `/me/password` to update your password.
* Visit `/me/remember` to enable, disable, or forget if you should be remembered.

=== Docker

See link:doc/docker.adoc[Docker] documentation for details.

=== Devices

Connecting your device to this server is as simple as using the captive WiFi portal on your mobile phone to connect your TRMNL device to your local network where this server is running. You can also delete your device, via the UI and/or API, and it'll be reconfigured for you automatically when the device next makes a link:doc/api.adoc#display[Display API] request. For more information (including dealing with tricky WiFi situations), check out the help guides below:

* link:https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/12263392-connect-your-device-to-terminus-byos[How to connect your device to Terminus].
* link:https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/11663377-setting-up-a-trmnl-on-tricky-wi-fi-situations[Dealing with tricky Wi-Fi situations].

=== Extensions

See link:doc/extensions.adoc[Extensions] documentation for details.

=== Background Pollers

See link:doc/background_pollers.adoc[Background Pollers] documentation for details.

=== API

See link:doc/api.adoc[API] documentation for details.

== Development

To contribute, ensure you have completed the link:#setup[Setup] and the entire project builds properly by running `bin/rake`.

=== Console

To access the console with direct access to all objects, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

Once in the console, you can interact with all objects. A few examples:

[source,ruby]
----
# Use a repository.
repository = Hanami.app["repositories.device"]

repository.all              # View all devices.
device = repository.find 1  # Find by Device ID.
----

=== YJIT

{yjit_link} is enabled by default, when detected, which means you have built and installed Ruby with YJIT enabled. If you didn't build Ruby with YJIT support, YJIT support will be ignored. That said, we _recommend_ you enable YJIT support since the performance improvements are worth it.

💡 To enable YJIT globally, ensure the `--yjit` flag is added to your `RUBYOPT` environment variable. Example: `export RUBYOPT="--yjit"`.

=== CSS

Pure CSS is used in order to avoid pulling in complicated frameworks. The following stylesheets allow you to customize the look and feel of this application as follows:

* *Bits*: These are the bits and small reusable components that make up the site. There is a file for each type.
* *Pages*: These are the pages that make up the site. There is a file for each unique page.
* *Colors*: Use to customize site colors.
* *Defaults*: Use to customize HTML element default styles.
* *Keyframes*: Use to customize keyframe behavior.
* *Layout*: Use to customize the site layout.
* *Settings*: Use to customize site settings.
* *View Transitions*: Use to customize view transitions.

=== HTML/CSS Sanitization

The link:https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize[Santize] gem is used to sanitize HTML/CSS when using the console, API, or UI. All of this configured via the `Terminus::Sanitizer` class which defaults to the `Sanitize::Config::RELAXED` style with additional support for `style` and `source` elements. If you find elements being stripped from your HTML/CSS content, this is why. Feel free to open an link:https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami/issues[issue] if you need additional support.

=== Logging

By default, all logging is set to `INFO` level but you can get more verbose information by using the `DEBUG` level. There are multiple ways to do this. First, you can export the desired debug level:

[source,bash]
----
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
----

You can also specify the log level before launching the server:

[source,bash]
----
LOG_LEVEL=debug overmind start --port-step 10 --procfile Procfile.dev --can-die assets,migrate
----

Finally, you can configure the app to use a different log level via `lib/terminus/lib_container.rb` by adjusting log level of logger during registration:

[source,ruby]
----
register(:logger) { Cogger.new id: :terminus, level: :debug, formatter: :detail }

----

💡 See the {cogger_link} gem documentation for further details.

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/rake
----
